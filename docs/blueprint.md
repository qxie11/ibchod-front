## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Apple's signature white (#FFFFFF) to reflect simplicity and elegance.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a subtle contrast without distracting from the products.
- Accent color: Blue (#007AFF) for interactive elements like buttons and links to align with Apple's UI standards.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, known for its readability on screens, used for both headlines and body text to maintain a modern, clean aesthetic.
- Use minimalistic icons, preferably from a set that closely matches Appleâ€™s SF Symbols, for a cohesive user experience.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout with ample white space to highlight the products and provide an uncluttered browsing experience.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for user interactions, such as adding items to the cart or navigating between product pages, to enhance the sense of fluidity and responsiveness.
